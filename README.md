# Time-Elapsed

## Ojective

Write a basic Python script to demonstrate the use of decorator and wrapper functions. Here I have built a app to calculate the run time of a function.

## Output

Even though the time depends of a number of factors but the expected result is going to like this.

```
1673159324.5405164
fast_function run speed: 0.40184998512268066
slow_function run speed: 3.3040003776550293
```
